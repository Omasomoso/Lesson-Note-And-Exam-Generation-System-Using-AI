make sure to create a .env file and in it add your free api keys immediately after the = sign. 
I may have stopped working on the image search function. if there is any issue, it would be
with the AI models so thats where you should look at, if theres any troubles. Enjoy!!!

.env file should be in yoour root folder along with the other.py files and it should have the following:

TOGETHER_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
IMAGE_SEARCH_ENABLED=True
